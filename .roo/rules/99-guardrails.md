# Workspace Guardrails

- Every mode **must** read docs/project-brief.md and backlog/status.json on start; ask Orchestrator if missing.
- Never commit secrets, .env files, or personal data.
- Run `npm run lint --fix` before marking a ticket completed.
- Keep replies ≤ 300 tokens unless diff or stack trace requires more.
